:QuestionText:
An active antenna consists of a short rod antenna and an amplifier. The short rod antenna converts the electric field at the antenna into a voltage. For frequencies of interest, this signal source can be modeled as a voltage source in series with a linear capacitor with a capacitance that is solely defined by the length and the diameter of the antenna. 
The peak value of the open-circuit voltage generated by the electric field equals 0.3V. The antenna capacitance equals 6pF.
The load of the antenna consists of a receiver. This receiver has an input impedance of 50Ohm. The receiver is connected to the active antenna by means of a long cable. The cable has a characteristic impedance of 50Ohm and should be driven from its charactersitic impedance.
The amplifier provides the load a copy of the source voltage: the peak open-circuit antenna voltage 0.3V should evoke a  peak voltage of 0.3V across the 50Ohm load. The frequency range of interest ranges from 10kHz to 30MHz. The transfer of the open-circuit antenna voltage to the load voltage over the frequency range of interest should have an MFM characteristic.
The figure shows a suggested solution for the amplifier.
Please indicate if this is a valid solution, and if not, why.
