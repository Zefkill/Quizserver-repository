:QuestionText:
The figure above shows a biased transistor stage with a signal source ($V_s$ and $R_s$) and a load resistor with a resistance $R_{\ell}$. The values $I_{GS}$ and $V_{GS}$ of the input bias sources have been assigned such that the zero-signal drain-source current $I_{DS}$ equals 100$\mu$A and the zero-signal drain-source voltage $V_{DS}$ equals 0.9V.
Please indicate if the following statement is true or false.
The quiescent power delivered by the input bias current source (value = $I_{GS}$) is zero because the quiescent voltage across this source equals zero.
:Feedback:
A network element delivers power if $\frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}v(t)i(t)dt<0$, where $v(t)$ is the element's branch voltage, $i(t)$ its branch current and $T$ the time interval of interest.
:Hint:
Study Chapter 3 and Chapter 18.
