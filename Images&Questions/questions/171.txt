:QuestionText:
The figure above shows a biased transistor stage with a signal source ($V_s$ and $R_s$) and a load resistor with a resistance $R_{\ell}$. The values $I_{GS}$ and $V_{GS}$ of the input bias sources have been assigned such that the zero-signal drain-source current $I_{DS}$ equals 100$\mu$A and the zero-signal drain-source voltage $V_{DS}$ equals 0.9V.
Please indicate if the following statement is true or false.
The maximum negative value of the load voltage is -0.9V.
