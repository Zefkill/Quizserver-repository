:QuestionText:
The figure above shows a circuit of a biased transistor. The NMOS transistor is biased in an operating point in which all bias voltages and currents are positive. The values of the bias sources are selected such that in the absence of a signal no bias currents are flowing through the source and through the load.
Which of the bias sources are delivering power (can be more than one) if the source voltage $V_s$ is positive?
