:QuestionText:
Consider the current to voltage transfer $H(s)=\frac{V_o}{I_s}$ of the network shown in the figure and select the correct statement:
:Feedback:
The circuit exhibits one free capacitor voltage and one cut set of a capacitor and a current source. Hence it has one pole in the origin. The capacitor in series with the signal path is an open circuit at $s=0$. Hence, the transfer has a zero at this frequency. This zero coincides with the pole and makes it not observable.

See Chapter 18
