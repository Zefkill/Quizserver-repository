:QuestionText:
An NMOS transistor is biased in its forward saturation region with a drain current $I_{DS}$. The transistor has a width $W$ and a length $L$. Under the given conditions the small-signal transconductance and the cut-off frequency of this transistor equal $g_m$ and $f_T$, respectively.
Select in which way the transconductance changes if the width and the drain current are changed to $2W$ and $2I_{DS}$, respectively.
:Feedback:
The transconductance depends on the transconductance factor $\beta_{sq}$, and the width and the length of the channel.
:Hint:
Study Chapter 4.
