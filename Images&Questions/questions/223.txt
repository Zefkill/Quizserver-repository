:QuestionText:
The open-circuit output voltage of a sensor shows an accurate relation with its input signal. An amplifier should accurately copy this information to its load. 
The driving current of this load should accurately correspond with the input signal of the sensor.
The amplifier can be represented as a two-port of which the T1 two-port parameters are linear, instantaneous and time-invariant (also: stationary or fixed).
Which of those two-port parameters need(s) to be zero in the case in which both:
1. The impedance of the sensor is accurately known, signal-independent and time-independent
2. The load impedance is inaccurately known, signal-dependent or time-dependent
:Feedback:
In this case, the output impedance of the amplifier should be infinite, and the input impedance should not depend on the load impedance. This is the case if both $A$ and $C$ are zero.
:Hint:
See section 2.3. For the definitions of system properties see section 17.2.
