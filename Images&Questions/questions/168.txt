:QuestionText:
Consider a CS stage which is driven from an ideal voltage source. The spectral density of the source-referred noise for this configuration equals $S_v=\frac{4kTn\Gamma}{g_m} \left( 1+ \frac{f_{\ell}}{f}\right)\left[\frac{V^2}{Hz} \right]$, where $n$ is the substrate factor, and $\Gamma$ equals 1/2 in weak inversion and 2/3 in strong inversion. The corner frequency of the 1/f noise depends on the cut-off frequency $f_T$ of the transistor: $f_{\ell}=\alpha f_T$ with $\alpha \ll 1$,.
