:QuestionText:
An NMOS transistor is biased in its forward saturation region with a drain current $I_{DS}$. The transistor has a width $W$ and a length $L$. Under the given conditions the small-signal transconductance and the cut-off frequency of this transistor equal $g_m$ and $f_T$, respectively.
Select in which way the cut-off frequency changes if the width and the drain current are changed to $2W$ and $2I_{DS}$, respectively.
:Feedback:
The cut-off frequency mainly depends on gm and the oxide capacitance. Consider the way in which these change under the described conditions.
:Hint:
Study Chapter 4.
