:QuestionText:
The short-circuit output current of a sensor shows an accurate relation with its input signal. An amplifier should accurately copy this information to its load. 
The driving voltage of this load should accurately correspond with the input signal of the sensor.
The amplifier can be represented as a two-port of which the T1 two-port parameters are linear, instantaneous and time-invariant (also: stationary or fixed).
Which of those two-port parameters need(s) to be zero in the case in which both:
1. The impedance of the sensor is inaccurately known, signal-dependent or time-dependent
2. The load impedance is accurately known, signal-independent and time-independent
:Feedback:
In this case, the input impedance of the amplifier should be zero and the output impedance should not depend on the source impedance. This is the case if both $A$ and $B$ are zero.
:Hint:
See section 2.3. For the definitions of system properties see section 17.2.
